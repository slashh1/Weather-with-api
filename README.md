`# Weather-with-api
THis is a presonal project of mine to get started with webpack and babel.
the API used in the project was from metaweather <a href="https://www.metaweather.com"></a>
the bundled code is in the dist folder
where as the source code is in the src folder
all the node modules used can be found in the package.json folder with their dependencies
